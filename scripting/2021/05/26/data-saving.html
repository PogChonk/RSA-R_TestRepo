<p>Too often we see people that combine PlayerAdded/PlayerRemoving to make datastore saving scripts.<br />
In theory this looks fine but in practice it doesn’t save your data half of the time, why?</p>

<h3 id="when-does-the-game-exit">When does the game exit?</h3>
<p>The game stops running under any of 3 conditions</p>
<ul>
  <li>All players have left the game</li>
  <li>A server shutdown was requested from the game page</li>
  <li>A game wide server migration was issued (basically server shutdown and teleport)</li>
</ul>

<p>When inside of studio you’re always alone, thus if you leave the game, the server will immediately kill itself since the last player left.</p>

<h3 id="asynchronous">Asynchronous</h3>
<p>It’s important to remember that requests to the datastores are made asychronously, it takes time to complete them, they’re not done just immediately.<br />
Knowing that the game immediately exits after the last player has left and that a datastore request takes time to complete, it’s obvious that the server shuts down before the datastore request can finish, at this point is when dataloss occurs.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-fix-it">How to fix it?</h3>
<p>Roblox provides a way that you can run code before the server immediately exits, game:BindToClose, you can bind any amount of functions to right before the game closes, these functions can run for at most 30 seconds before the server kills itself anyway.<br />
The way we use this is to save the data for all remaining players to make sure everything is saved before we exit the server.</p>

<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">function SaveData(player)
  -- implement your saving logic here
end

game.Players.PlayerRemoving:Connect(SaveData)
game:BindToClose(function()
  for _, player in ipairs(game.Players:GetPlayers()) do
    SaveData(player)
  end
end)
</code></pre>

<h4 id="i-get-a-weird-warning-in-the-console-saying-datastore-request-was-added-to-the-queue">I get a weird warning in the console saying “Datastore request was added to the queue”.</h4>

<p>This is because you’re making two simultaneous write requests, 1 issued by PlayerRemoving and the other one issued by BindToClose. You can safely ignore this warning because Roblox can only write to the same datastore key every 6 seconds anyway.</p>
